# Tier-Based Generation Limits Implementation

## ‚úÖ What Was Implemented

Successfully integrated Whop access pass verification with Prisma-based usage tracking to enforce tier-based generation limits.

---

## üéØ Generation Limits by Tier

| Tier | Price | Limit/Month | Access Pass Required |
|------|-------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Starter** | $9 | 50 generations | ‚úÖ Required |
| **Creator** | $29 | 500 generations | ‚úÖ Required |
| **Pro** | $99 | 1,500 generations | ‚úÖ Required |
| **Brand** | $69 | 1,000 generations | ‚úÖ Required |
| **Admin** | N/A | Unlimited | üëë Admin status |

---

## üìã Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema (Prisma)

**Updated:** `prisma/schema.prisma`

Added usage tracking fields to the `User` model:

```prisma
model User {
  // ... existing fields ...
  
  // NEW: Usage tracking
  currentTier        String?    // "starter" | "creator" | "brand" | "pro"
  generationsUsed    Int        @default(0)
  generationsLimit   Int?       // tier-based limit
  usageResetDate     DateTime?  // when to reset counter
}
```

**Status:** Schema updated, client regenerated. Database migration will run on first Vercel deployment.

---

### 2. Core Usage Library

**Created:** `src/lib/whop-usage.ts`

Two main functions:

#### `getUserTierAndUsage(whopUserId: string)`
- Checks which Whop access pass the user has purchased
- Creates or updates user record in database
- Returns tier and usage information
- Automatically resets usage if past reset date
- Updates tier if user upgraded/downgraded

#### `incrementUsage(whopUserId: string)`
- Increments usage counter after successful image generation
- Returns true/false for success

---

### 3. API Routes

#### Updated: `src/app/api/process-image/route.ts`

**Before:**
- Trusted all requests from Whop platform
- No usage tracking
- No access pass verification

**After:**
- Verifies Whop user token
- Checks admin status (unlimited access)
- Verifies user has purchased an access pass
- Checks if user has remaining generations
- Increments usage after successful generation
- Returns detailed error messages with usage info

**Error Responses:**
```json
// No access pass
{
  "error": "No access",
  "message": "You need to purchase an access pass to use this feature.",
  "isPremiumFeature": true,
  "redirectTo": "/plans"
}

// Limit reached
{
  "error": "Limit reached",
  "message": "You've used all 50 generations for this month. Upgrade or wait for reset.",
  "usage": {
    "used": 50,
    "limit": 50,
    "resetDate": "2025-11-01T00:00:00.000Z"
  },
  "redirectTo": "/plans"
}
```

#### Created: `src/app/api/usage/current/route.ts`

New endpoint for frontend to fetch usage stats:

**Response:**
```json
{
  "hasAccess": true,
  "isAdmin": false,
  "tier": "creator",
  "usage": {
    "used": 150,
    "limit": 500,
    "remaining": 350,
    "resetDate": "2025-11-01T00:00:00.000Z"
  }
}
```

---

### 4. Frontend Component

**Updated:** `src/components/UsageStatus.tsx`

- Changed to call `/api/usage/current` instead of old Supabase endpoints
- Displays tier and usage information
- Shows "Admin" badge for admin users
- Shows "Member" for users with access passes

---

### 5. Webhook Handlers

**Updated:**
- `src/app/api/webhooks/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/whop/subscribe/route.ts`

Changed from Supabase to Prisma:
- Use `prisma.user.upsert()` instead of `supabaseAdmin.from('members').upsert()`
- Store tier and limits in User model
- Automatically set usage reset date

---

### 6. Cleanup

**Deleted Files:**
- `src/lib/usage.ts` - Old Supabase-based usage tracking
- `src/lib/supabase/admin.ts` - Supabase admin client
- `src/lib/supabase/client.ts` - Supabase client
- `src/lib/supabase/server.ts` - Supabase server client
- `src/app/api/use-generation/route.ts` - Old generation endpoint
- `src/app/api/add-credits/route.ts` - Old credits endpoint
- `src/app/api/usage/status/route.ts` - Old usage endpoint

**Reason:** Consolidated to use Prisma exclusively for database access.

---

## üîÑ How It Works

### User Flow

1. **User accesses app through Whop**
   - Whop shows app only if user purchased access

2. **User uploads and edits image**
   - Frontend calls `/api/process-image`
   - Server verifies Whop user token
   - Server checks which access pass user has
   - Server checks usage limits

3. **Access Granted**
   - Image is processed
   - Usage counter increments
   - Returns edited image

4. **Limit Reached**
   - Returns 429 error
   - Frontend shows upgrade prompt
   - User redirected to `/plans` page

### Monthly Reset

- Usage resets automatically on the user's renewal date
- Reset date is set when user first subscribes
- Calculated as: current date + 1 month

### Admin Bypass

Admins configured in `ADMIN_WHOP_USER_IDS` or `NEXT_PUBLIC_WHOP_AGENT_USER_ID`:
- Bypass all usage checks
- Get unlimited generations
- Show as "Admin" in UI

---

## üîê Environment Variables Required

Ensure these are set in Vercel:

```bash
# Whop Access Pass IDs (CRITICAL - for verification)
NEXT_PUBLIC_ACCESS_PASS_STARTER_ID="pass_XXXXXXXX"
NEXT_PUBLIC_ACCESS_PASS_CREATOR_ID="pass_XXXXXXXX"
NEXT_PUBLIC_ACCESS_PASS_PRO_ID="pass_XXXXXXXX"
NEXT_PUBLIC_ACCESS_PASS_BRAND_ID="pass_XXXXXXXX"

# Whop Plan IDs (for checkout)
NEXT_PUBLIC_WHOP_PLAN_STARTER_ID="plan_XXXXXXXX"
NEXT_PUBLIC_WHOP_PLAN_CREATOR_ID="plan_XXXXXXXX"
NEXT_PUBLIC_WHOP_PLAN_PRO_ID="plan_XXXXXXXX"
NEXT_PUBLIC_WHOP_PLAN_BRAND_ID="plan_XXXXXXXX"

# Admin Users (unlimited access)
ADMIN_WHOP_USER_IDS="user_XXXXXXXX,user_YYYYYYYY"
NEXT_PUBLIC_WHOP_AGENT_USER_ID="user_XXXXXXXX"

# Whop API
NEXT_PUBLIC_WHOP_APP_ID="app_XXXXXXXX"
WHOP_API_KEY="whop_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
NEXT_PUBLIC_WHOP_COMPANY_ID="biz_XXXXXXXX"

# Database
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://..."
DIRECT_URL="postgresql://..."

# Google AI
GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY="your_api_key"
```

## üìä Database Schema Changes

The Prisma schema now includes usage tracking. On first deployment, Vercel will automatically apply these changes to your Supabase PostgreSQL database.

**New columns in `User` table:**
- `currentTier` - Current subscription tier
- `generationsUsed` - Number of generations used this period
- `generationsLimit` - Maximum generations allowed per period
- `usageResetDate` - When usage counter resets

---

## üß™ Testing Checklist

### Admin Testing
- [ ] Admin user can upload and edit images
- [ ] Shows "Admin" in UI
- [ ] No usage limits enforced
- [ ] Logs show: `üëë Admin user - unlimited access`

### Paid User Testing (with Access Pass)
- [ ] User with Starter pass can edit images
- [ ] Usage counter increments after each edit
- [ ] Shows current usage in UI (e.g., "15/50 generations used")
- [ ] Logs show: `‚úÖ User verified - starter tier (35 remaining)`
- [ ] Hitting limit shows upgrade prompt
- [ ] Usage resets after 30 days

### Non-Paid User Testing
- [ ] User without access pass gets blocked
- [ ] Error message: "You need to purchase an access pass"
- [ ] Redirected to `/plans` page
- [ ] Logs show: `‚ùå User has no access pass`

### Tier Upgrade Testing
- [ ] User upgrades from Starter to Pro
- [ ] Tier updates in database
- [ ] New limit applies immediately
- [ ] Usage counter persists

## üöÄ Deployment Status

**Committed:** ‚úÖ All changes committed  
**Pushed:** ‚úÖ Pushed to GitHub main branch  
**Vercel:** üîÑ Deployment in progress  

**Expected build time:** ~2-3 minutes

## üìù Next Steps

1. **Monitor Vercel deployment**
   - Check for successful build
   - Verify database migration applied

2. **Test in production**
   - Test admin access
   - Test with access pass
   - Test without access pass
   - Verify usage tracking

3. **Monitor logs**
   - Check Vercel logs for user activity
   - Verify access pass checks working
   - Confirm usage increments

4. **Optional enhancements**
   - Add usage analytics dashboard
   - Add email notifications for limit reached
   - Add overage pricing (charge per generation beyond limit)
   - Add usage graphs in UI

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Authentication failed" error
- **Cause:** Whop headers not being passed
- **Check:** User accessing through Whop iframe?
- **Solution:** Always access via Whop platform, not direct Vercel URL

### "No access pass" error for paid users
- **Cause:** Access Pass IDs not set or incorrect
- **Check:** Environment variables in Vercel
- **Solution:** Verify access pass IDs match your Whop dashboard

### Database connection errors
- **Cause:** DATABASE_URL not set correctly
- **Check:** Vercel environment variables
- **Solution:** Copy from Supabase dashboard

### Usage not incrementing
- **Cause:** `incrementUsage()` call failing
- **Check:** Vercel logs for Prisma errors
- **Solution:** Verify database schema is up to date
