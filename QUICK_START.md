# ðŸš€ Quick Start - Launch Your App Now!

## What Was Just Implemented âœ…

1. **Monthly Usage Reset Cron Job** - Automatically resets user limits on the 1st of each month
2. **Health Check Endpoint** - Monitor system status at `/api/health`
3. **Complete Testing Guide** - Step-by-step instructions in `LAUNCH_GUIDE.md`
4. **Cron Secret Generator** - Helper script to generate secure authentication

---

## Next Steps (Do These Now!)

### Step 1: Generate CRON_SECRET (5 minutes)

```bash
# Run the generator
bash setup-cron-secret.sh

# Copy the output and add to .env.local
echo 'CRON_SECRET="paste_your_generated_secret_here"' >> .env.local
```

Then add the same secret to **Vercel**:
- Go to Vercel Dashboard â†’ Your Project â†’ Settings â†’ Environment Variables
- Add: `CRON_SECRET` = `your_generated_secret`
- Apply to: Production, Preview, Development

---

### Step 2: Deploy to Vercel (2 minutes)

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add monthly usage reset and health check"
git push
```

Wait for deployment to complete in Vercel dashboard.

---

### Step 3: Verify Deployment (3 minutes)

**Test Health Check:**
```bash
curl https://your-app.vercel.app/api/health
```

Expected: Status 200 with all services "healthy"

**Test Cron Endpoint:**
```bash
curl -X GET https://your-app.vercel.app/api/cron/reset-usage \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CRON_SECRET"
```

Expected: Status 200 with reset statistics

**Check Vercel Dashboard:**
- Go to Settings â†’ Crons
- Should see: `/api/cron/reset-usage` scheduled

---

### Step 4: Test User Flow (15 minutes)

Follow the complete testing guide in `LAUNCH_GUIDE.md`, Phase 1:

1. âœ… Test user purchase flow
2. âœ… Test access verification
3. âœ… Test image editing
4. âœ… Test usage tracking
5. âœ… Test usage limits

---

### Step 5: Launch! (5 minutes)

1. Switch Whop app to "Production" mode
2. Publish your app in Whop dashboard
3. Monitor first users in Vercel logs

## ðŸ“‹ Key Files to Reference

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `LAUNCH_GUIDE.md` | Complete testing and launch instructions |
| `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` | Details of what was just added |
| `ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES_GUIDE.md` | All environment variables explained |
| `setup-cron-secret.sh` | Generate CRON_SECRET |

---

## ðŸ†˜ Quick Troubleshooting

### Health check fails
â†’ Check environment variables in Vercel
â†’ Verify database connection in Supabase

### Cron endpoint returns 401
â†’ Verify CRON_SECRET matches between local and Vercel
â†’ Check Authorization header format: `Bearer YOUR_SECRET`

### Cron not scheduled
â†’ Redeploy to Vercel
â†’ Check vercel.json has crons array
â†’ View Settings â†’ Crons in Vercel dashboard
