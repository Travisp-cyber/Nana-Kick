# Fix Vercel Deployment Protection for Whop Integration

## The Problem
Your Vercel deployment has "Deployment Protection" enabled, which blocks access to your app's API endpoints. This prevents Whop from authenticating users properly.

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Disable Deployment Protection (Recommended)
1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Click on your "nana-kick" project
3. Go to "Settings" â†’ "Deployment Protection"
4. Turn OFF deployment protection
5. Save changes

### Option 2: Configure Protection to Allow Whop
1. In the same Deployment Protection settings
2. Add "*.whop.com" to the allowed domains
3. Enable "Allow iframe embedding"

### Option 3: Use CLI (if available)
Run: `vercel project settings update --deployment-protection false`

## Test After Changes
1. Access your app through Whop (not directly)
2. Try uploading an image
3. Check that you're not seeing the "Members only" gate

## New Production URL
Your latest deployment is at:
https://nana-kick-i23iraczd-travis-parks-projects.vercel.app

Make sure your Whop app settings point to this URL.
