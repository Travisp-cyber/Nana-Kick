# Whop Webhook Integration Test Results

## ‚úÖ Current Status

### 1. **Webhook Endpoint is Live**
- **URL**: `https://nana-kick.vercel.app/api/webhooks`
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Accepting requests and returning 200 OK
- **Test Result**: Successfully processed test events

### 2. **Test Results**
- ‚úÖ Webhook endpoint responds to POST requests
- ‚úÖ Returns success response for valid events
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  Database writes are not working (likely due to missing webhook secret or API errors)

## üîç Issues Found

### 1. **Database Not Receiving Data**
The webhook handler is responding but data isn't being saved to the database. This could be due to:
- Missing `WHOP_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in Vercel environment variables
- Webhook signature verification failing (returns success but skips processing)
- API calls to Whop failing due to authentication

### 2. **Environment Variables**
Make sure these are set in Vercel:
```
WHOP_WEBHOOK_SECRET=<get-from-whop-dashboard>
WHOP_API_KEY=<already-set>
DATABASE_URL=<already-set>
```

## üìã Next Steps to Complete Integration

### 1. **Set Up Webhook in Whop Dashboard**

1. Go to [Whop Developer Dashboard](https://whop.com/dashboard/developer)
2. Select your app
3. Add webhook endpoint: `https://nana-kick.vercel.app/api/webhooks`
4. Select these events:
   - `app.installed`
   - `app.uninstalled`
   - `membership.went_valid`
   - `membership.went_invalid`
   - `payment.completed`
   - `payment.failed`

### 2. **Get and Add Webhook Secret**

After creating the webhook in Whop:
1. Copy the webhook secret (starts with `whsec_`)
2. Add to Vercel environment variables:
   - Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
   - Select your project
   - Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
   - Add `WHOP_WEBHOOK_SECRET` with the value

### 3. **Redeploy Your App**

After adding the environment variable:
```bash
vercel --prod
```

Or trigger a redeploy from the Vercel dashboard.

### 4. **Test with Real Whop Events**

Once configured:
1. Use Whop's "Send test event" feature
2. Check Vercel function logs for the webhook handler
3. Run `node check-db.js` to verify data is being saved

## üß™ Testing Tools Created

### 1. **Webhook Tester** (`test-webhook.js`)
Send test webhook events to your endpoint:
```bash
# Test membership creation
node test-webhook.js membership.went_valid

# Test payment
node test-webhook.js payment.completed

# Test locally (when running dev server)
node test-webhook.js membership.went_valid --local
```

### 2. **Database Checker** (`check-db.js`)
Check what's in your database:
```bash
node check-db.js
```

## üö® Common Issues & Solutions

### Webhook Not Processing
1. **Check Vercel Logs**: Look for errors in function logs
2. **Verify Environment Variables**: Especially `WHOP_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
3. **Test Without Signature**: Temporarily disable signature verification for testing

### Database Errors
1. **Check Connection**: Ensure `DATABASE_URL` is correct
2. **Verify Tables**: Run the SQL migration in Supabase if needed
3. **Check Constraints**: Foreign key errors if related records don't exist

### API Errors
1. **Verify API Key**: Ensure `WHOP_API_KEY` is valid
2. **Check Permissions**: API key needs proper scopes
3. **Rate Limits**: Check if hitting API rate limits

## üìä Monitoring

### Check Webhook Activity
```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor
SELECT * FROM "AccessLog" 
WHERE resource LIKE 'webhook_%' 
ORDER BY "createdAt" DESC 
LIMIT 20;
```

### View Recent Memberships
```sql
SELECT m.*, u.email, u.name 
FROM "Membership" m
JOIN "User" u ON m."userId" = u.id
ORDER BY m."createdAt" DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria
