# Free Trial Feature - Complete Implementation Summary

## 🎉 What's Been Implemented

Your Nana Kick app now includes a **10-generation free trial** for all new users! This allows users to test the AI image editing experience before committing to a paid plan.

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. **10 Free Generations for New Users**
- Every new user automatically gets 10 free AI image edits
- No payment required to start using the app
- Perfect for testing the experience and seeing the value

### 2. **Smart Usage Priority**
When a user edits an image, the system deducts usage in this priority order:
1. **Free trial first** (if remaining)
2. **Plan limit** (if within subscription)
3. **Overage charges** (if over limit)

### 3. **Carryover System**
- Remaining free generations stack with paid plans
- Example: User has 5 free generations left, purchases Starter (50/month)
  - Total available: 5 + 50 = 55 generations
- This encourages users to upgrade before exhausting their trial

### 4. **Clear User Experience**

#### Free Trial Active
- UI displays: "Free Trial: X remaining" with blue/purple progress bar
- Warning at ≤3 remaining: "⚠️ Only X free generations left - Upgrade for more!"

#### Free Trial Exhausted
- Clear blocking message: "You used all of your free credits. To keep editing, upgrade to one of our plans."
- Users cannot upload or edit new images
- "Upgrade" button prominently displayed

#### Plans Page
- Banner shows: "🎁 Free Trial Active: You have X free generations remaining"
- After exhaustion: "⚠️ Free Trial Used: You've used all your free credits"

### 5. **One-Time Trial**
- `hasClaimedFreeTrial` flag prevents re-claiming
- Users get the trial only once (even if they delete and recreate accounts)

### 6. **Admin Bypass**
- Admin users skip the free trial system entirely
- Admins continue to have unlimited access (current behavior)

## 📁 Files Modified

### Database Schema
**`prisma/schema.prisma`**
- Added `freeTrialUsed` (Int, default 10) - Remaining free generations
- Added `hasClaimedFreeTrial` (Boolean, default false) - One-time flag

### Backend Logic
**`src/lib/whop-usage.ts`**
- Updated `getUserTierAndUsage()` to grant access for users with free trial
- Modified `incrementUsage()` to prioritize free trial usage first
- All database operations now include free trial fields

**`src/app/api/process-image/route.ts`**
- Added free trial exhaustion check
- Blocks upload/edit when trial is exhausted
- Returns specific error message for exhausted trials

### Frontend UI
**`src/components/UsageStatus.tsx`**
- Displays "Free Trial: X remaining" with blue/purple progress bar
- Shows warning when ≤3 generations remain
- Distinct styling for free trial vs paid plans

**`src/app/plans/page.tsx`**
- Added free trial status banners
- Shows remaining generations if trial active
- Highlights exhausted trial to encourage upgrade

### API
**`src/app/api/usage/current/route.ts`**
- Automatically returns free trial data (no changes needed)
- Leverages updated `getUserTierAndUsage()` function

## 🗄️ Database Setup

### SQL Commands for Supabase

Run these in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Add free trial tracking columns to the User table
ALTER TABLE "User" ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS "freeTrialUsed" INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 10;
ALTER TABLE "User" ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS "hasClaimedFreeTrial" BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE;
```

### What Happens to Existing Users?

When you run the SQL commands:
- **Existing users**: Get `freeTrialUsed: 10` and `hasClaimedFreeTrial: false`
  - They'll get the free trial retroactively (bonus for early users!)
- **Users with active subscriptions**: Free trial is ignored, they use their plan limits
- **New users going forward**: Automatically get 10 free generations

If you want existing users to NOT get the trial, run this instead:
```sql
ALTER TABLE "User" ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS "freeTrialUsed" INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE "User" ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS "hasClaimedFreeTrial" BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT TRUE;
```

## 🚀 Deployment Status

- ✅ Code committed to GitHub
- ✅ Vercel auto-deployment in progress
- ⏳ Database columns need to be added manually in Supabase

## 📋 Testing Checklist

After running the SQL commands in Supabase, test the following:

### Basic Flow
- [ ] New user authenticates → automatically gets 10 free generations
- [ ] Use 1 generation → UI shows "9 remaining"
- [ ] Use 5 total → UI shows "5 remaining"
- [ ] Use 8 total → UI shows warning "Only 2 free generations left"

### Exhaustion Flow
- [ ] Use all 10 free generations
- [ ] Try to upload/edit new image → blocked with message
- [ ] Error message: "You used all of your free credits. To keep editing, upgrade to one of our plans."
- [ ] "Upgrade" button visible and functional

### Upgrade Flow
- [ ] User with 5 free remaining purchases Starter plan
- [ ] Verify total available: 5 + 50 = 55 generations
- [ ] Use 5 generations → should use free first, then plan limit
- [ ] After 5 used → plan shows 50/50 remaining

### Plans Page
- [ ] Free trial active → banner shows "You have X free generations remaining"
- [ ] Free trial exhausted → banner shows "You've used all your free credits"
- [ ] Banner links to upgrade options

### Admin Bypass
- [ ] Admin user logs in
- [ ] Verify admin bypasses free trial entirely
- [ ] Verify admin has unlimited access (existing behavior)

### Edge Cases
- [ ] User with 0 free trial + no subscription → blocked
- [ ] User with subscription → uses plan limit, not free trial
- [ ] UsageStatus component displays correctly for all states

## 🎯 User Journey Examples

### Example 1: Trial User → Upgrade
1. User downloads app → gets 10 free generations
2. Uses 7 generations → loves the results
3. Sees warning: "Only 3 free generations left"
4. Purchases Creator plan ($29/month)
5. Now has: 3 free + 500 plan = 503 total generations
6. Uses remaining 3 free first, then taps into plan limit

### Example 2: Trial Exhaustion → Upgrade
1. User downloads app → gets 10 free generations
2. Uses all 10 generations
3. Tries to edit another image → blocked
4. Message: "You used all of your free credits. To keep editing, upgrade to one of our plans."
5. Clicks "Upgrade" → sees plans page
6. Purchases Starter plan → immediately can edit again

### Example 3: Existing Paid User
1. User already has Creator subscription
2. Free trial is ignored (they're already paying)
3. Uses their 500 generations per month as normal
4. Overage pricing applies if they exceed 500

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Access Check Logic (getUserTierAndUsage)
```
1. Check if user is admin → grant unlimited access
2. Check for active subscription → grant tier-based access
3. Check for free trial remaining → grant free trial access (tier: 'free-trial', limit: 10)
4. If none of above → deny access
```

### Usage Increment Logic (incrementUsage)
```
1. If freeTrialUsed > 0 → decrement freeTrialUsed, set hasClaimedFreeTrial: true
2. Else if generationsUsed < generationsLimit → increment generationsUsed
3. Else → increment overageUsed and overageCharges
```

### Blocking Logic (process-image route)
```
1. If hasAccess == false AND freeTrialUsed == 0 → Block with "Free trial exhausted" message
2. If hasAccess == false AND user doesn't exist → Block with generic "No access" message
3. If hasAccess == true → Allow processing
```

## 📊 Expected Impact

### Conversion Funnel
1. **Awareness**: User discovers Nana Kick
2. **Trial**: Downloads and tries 10 free generations (no barrier)
3. **Activation**: Experiences the value of AI editing
4. **Consideration**: Sees warning at 3 remaining → considers upgrading
5. **Conversion**: Exhausts trial OR upgrades early to keep going
6. **Retention**: Paid user with carryover benefits

### Business Benefits
- **Lower barrier to entry**: No payment required to try
- **Product validation**: Users experience value before buying
- **Higher conversion**: 10 edits is enough to see value but not enough to satisfy needs
- **Carryover incentive**: Users upgrade before exhausting to maximize value
- **Clear upgrade path**: Blocked state provides clear next steps

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Free trial not showing for new users
- **Check**: Database columns added? Run SQL commands in Supabase
- **Check**: Vercel deployment successful? Check deployment logs
- **Check**: Browser cache? Hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R)

### Issue: Existing users getting free trial
- **Expected**: With default SQL (10 generations), all users get trial
- **Fix**: Run alternative SQL with `DEFAULT 0` and `DEFAULT TRUE` (see Database Setup above)

### Issue: Free trial not counting down
- **Check**: `incrementUsage()` being called in process-image route?
- **Check**: Database connection working? Check Supabase logs
- **Debug**: Check browser console for API errors

### Issue: Build failing
- **Check**: TypeScript errors? Run `pnpm run build` locally
- **Check**: Prisma client generated? Run `npx prisma generate`
- **Fix**: Read error message and fix accordingly

## 🎊 Next Steps

1. **Add database columns**: Run SQL in Supabase (see commands above)
2. **Verify deployment**: Check Vercel deployment status
3. **Test free trial**: Create new user and test full flow
4. **Monitor analytics**: Track conversion rates from trial to paid
5. **Iterate**: Adjust trial limit (10 generations) based on data

## 📝 Notes

- Free trial works independently of Whop subscriptions
- Admin users always bypass free trial
- One-time trial per user (cannot be reset)
- Carryover is automatic (no extra code needed)
- Works seamlessly with existing overage pricing system
