## New Feature: Daily Usage Reset Cron (Just Added!)

### What It Does
Automatically resets user generation limits on their individual subscription anniversary date.
Runs daily at midnight UTC to check which users need their limits reset.

### Setup Required

1. **Generate a CRON_SECRET**
   
   Run this command to generate a secure random secret:
   ```bash
   openssl rand -base64 32
   ```

2. **Add CRON_SECRET to Environment Variables**

   **Local (`.env.local`):**
   ```bash
   CRON_SECRET="your_generated_secret_here"
   ```

   **Vercel:**
   - Go to Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Your Project ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
   - Add new variable:
     - Name: `CRON_SECRET`
     - Value: `your_generated_secret_here`
     - Environments: Production, Preview, Development

3. **Deploy to Vercel**
   
   The cron job is configured in `vercel.json` and will be automatically set up on deployment.
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add monthly usage reset cron job"
   git push
   ```

### Testing the Cron Endpoint

Test manually before relying on the scheduled job:

```bash
# Replace with your actual values
curl -X GET https://your-app.vercel.app/api/cron/reset-usage \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CRON_SECRET"
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Usage reset completed successfully",
  "usersReset": 2,
  "nextResetDate": "2025-11-01T00:00:00.000Z",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-12T10:30:00.000Z",
  "details": [
    {
      "whopUserId": "user_xxxxx",
      "previousUsage": 45,
      "tier": "creator"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Vercel Cron Job Configuration

The cron job is configured in `vercel.json`:
- **Path:** `/api/cron/reset-usage`
- **Schedule:** `0 0 * * *` (midnight every day, UTC)
- **Purpose:** Resets users on their individual subscription anniversary dates

You can view cron job logs in:
- Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Your Project ‚Üí Logs ‚Üí Filter by `/api/cron`

---

## Phase 1: Complete User Flow Testing

### Test 1: User Purchase Flow

1. **Create a Test Account**
   - Use a different Whop account (or incognito mode)
   - Make sure it's NOT in your `ADMIN_WHOP_USER_IDS` list

2. **Purchase an Access Pass**
   - Go to your Whop app page
   - Purchase the "Starter" plan (cheapest for testing)
   - Complete the checkout

3. **Verify Webhook Received**
   - Go to Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Your Project ‚Üí Logs
   - Filter for `/api/webhooks`
   - Look for log entry with purchase event
   - Should see: `[Whop Webhook] Received:` with event details

4. **Check Database**
   - Go to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Table Editor ‚Üí `User` table
   - Find your test user (search by email or whopUserId)
   - Verify fields:
     - `currentTier` = "starter"
     - `generationsUsed` = 0
     - `generationsLimit` = 50
     - `usageResetDate` = (next month)

### Test 2: Access Verification & Image Editing

1. **Login with Test User**
   - Access your app through Whop iframe
   - Should show "Member" or tier name in usage status

2. **Upload and Edit an Image**
   - Upload a test image
   - Enter editing instructions (e.g., "make it brighter")
   - Click "Submit Instructions"
   - Wait for processing (may take 10-30 seconds)

3. **Verify Success**
   - Edited image should display
   - Usage status should update (e.g., "49/50 remaining")
   - Check Vercel logs for success messages:
     ```
     ‚úÖ User verified - starter tier (49 remaining): user_xxxxx
     üìä Usage incremented for user: user_xxxxx
     ```

4. **Check Database Again**
   - Supabase ‚Üí `User` table ‚Üí Your test user
   - `generationsUsed` should now be 1

### Test 3: Usage Limit Enforcement

1. **Manually Set User to Limit**
   - In Supabase, edit your test user
   - Set `generationsUsed` = 50 (same as `generationsLimit`)
   - Save

2. **Try to Edit Another Image**
   - Should get error: "You've used all 50 generations for this month"
   - Should show option to upgrade
   - Verify in Vercel logs: `‚ùå User exceeded limit:`

### Test 4: Admin Access

1. **Login with Your Admin Account**
   - Use account listed in `ADMIN_WHOP_USER_IDS`
   - Should show "Admin" in usage status

2. **Verify Unlimited Access**
   - Upload and edit multiple images
   - Should work without limit checks
   - Vercel logs should show: `üëë Admin user - unlimited access:`

### Test 5: Monthly Usage Reset

1. **Manually Trigger Reset**
   ```bash
   curl -X GET https://your-app.vercel.app/api/cron/reset-usage \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CRON_SECRET"
   ```

2. **Verify Reset**
   - Check response JSON (should show users reset)
   - Check Supabase ‚Üí Users with used generations should be reset to 0
   - Check `usageResetDate` updated to next month

3. **Test User Can Edit Again**
   - Login with test user who was at limit
   - Should now be able to edit images again

## Phase 2: Health Check Verification

### Test the Health Endpoint

```bash
curl https://your-app.vercel.app/api/health
```

**Expected Response (200 OK):**
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-10-12T10:30:00.000Z",
  "status": "healthy",
  "services": {
    "database": {
      "status": "healthy",
      "message": "Database connection successful"
    },
    "googleAI": {
      "status": "healthy",
      "message": "Google AI API key configured"
    },
    "whopAPI": {
      "status": "healthy",
      "message": "Whop API fully configured"
    },
    "environment": {
      "status": "healthy",
      "message": "Environment: production"
    }
  }
}
```

**If Unhealthy (503):**
- Check which service is failing
